sum_of_squares = sum([x**2 for x in range(1,6)])
# In this code, a list comprehension [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)] is used to generate a lis
#t of squares of numbers ranging from 1 to 5. The sum() function is then used to calcula
#te the sum of the elements in the generated list, resulting in the sum of squares.
